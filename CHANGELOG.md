# Changelog

## 0.1.0 Alpha

The first playable build: the proof of concept works in game.

- **Robot Link:** link any mech, android, drone or spiderbot you look at (J, or from the terminal). Quest NPCs are refused. Orders: follow, hold, move to target.
- **Pilot Mode (Militech Minotaur):** take the mech's sensor feed with L.
  - WASD walks the mech, relative to where the torso looks.
  - The mouse turns the torso with weight.
  - LMB/RMB fire the two MK.31 HMGs. Fire modes: staggered (default), linked salvo, split.
  - Militech HUD.
  - V is locked in place while piloting, and a save lock is held.
- **Camera:**
  - The position is pinned to the sensor mount, so it no longer drifts off the mech or shakes against its steps.
  - The weight is in the torso turn, footfall jolts and recoil.
  - The default mount is lower and further forward: 2.3 m up, 2.6 m ahead.
  - Height, forward offset and mouse sensitivity can be tuned live in SETTINGS.
- **Terminal:** built on the standalone TerminalKit. It has LINK, SETTINGS and TOOLS (TerminalKit Tools) tabs, and the palette is saved.
- **Guns and chassis:** the MK.31s are fixed to the body, so the body now keeps turning toward where the torso aims. It turns in place while standing and faces the aim point while walking. The guns only fire once the chassis is within 15 degrees of the reticle, so the muzzle flash and the rounds agree. Until then the HUD shows ALIGNING CHASSIS.
- **Test tools:** spawn a Militech Minotaur from the terminal.
- **Diagnostics:** an optional DBG readout on the pilot HUD (SETTINGS > DEBUG READOUT). Log lines, including a note when the mech jumps more than 3 m in one frame, go to TOOLS > LOG.

Known issues:
- **Mech jumps:** the mech has been seen jumping away while piloted. That's now logged so the cause can be found.
- **Jump key:** Space can still make V jump if the game's NoJump restriction doesn't hold.
- **Guns:** they fire in game. Whether the flash and the rounds now line up is still to be confirmed.
- **Gamepad:** not supported yet.
